NOTICE: My configuration for AwesomeWM only works on the latest git master branch. On Arch based distros, all you would have todo is install `awesome-git` from the AUR. On others, you will have to build it manually.

## Setup
This repository has submodules, so make sure you clone it correctly:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:JavaCafe01/awesome-config.git ~/.config/awesome
```
## Modules
### :star: [bling](https://github.com/Nooo37/bling) :star:
Bling brings extra utilities to AwesomeWM such as tabs, swallowing, layouts, and flash focus. Please check it out and give it a star!

### [collision](https://github.com/Elv13/collision)
Collision is great for window navigation. It is created by one of the AwesomeWM devs, and is a great utility for your configuration. Give this one a star as well!
